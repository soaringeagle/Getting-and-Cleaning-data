# Getting-and-Cleaning-data
Project for Getting and Cleaning Data, a course in Data Science series.

Introduction

This repository contains my project works for the course  "Getting and Cleaning data", a part of the Data Science specialization.

About the raw data

 The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Data processing

0. Download, unzip the original file
1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, name the columns of subjects, activities, and features.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a tidy data set(tidyDataset.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This tidyDataset.txt file can also be found in this repository.


CodeBook

The CodeBook.md file describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
